<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Sync Phone to FTP server</strong></h2>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Version 1</strong></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Application aims to sync <strong>recursivly</strong> selected folders on your phone to an ftp server.</p>
<h2>Configure FTP:</h2>
<p>Go to Settings by pressing the dots on the right of the toolbar</p>
<p><img src="h1.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>If your FTP server is not accessible from the outside, you can sync when you are inside the network.</p>
<p>On next release, I will support sftp and ftps.</p>
<h2>Folder Sync</h2>
<p>After Creating the FTP, you can go to the directories you want to sync and press the left cloud button <img src="unfollow.png" alt="" />&nbsp;on the toolbar so it converts to green <img src="follow.png" alt="" />.</p>
<p>By doing that, the folder is added to the files that should be synced.</p>
<p>Dont Forget to press the sync button&nbsp;<img src="add.png" alt="" /> in order to start syncing the folders you selected to be synced.</p>
<h2>Sync Rule</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
    <li>In this version, the Sync is done each time you open the application or press the sync button&nbsp;<img src="add.png" alt="" /></li>
    <li>In this version,&nbsp;The backup is recursive. if you sync a folder, all its sub-folders will be synced.</li>
    <li>The file will be synced only once unless you changed its name and the parent directory is still synced.</li>
    <li>each time you login, the files that failed to sync will be synced again</li>
    <li>If you selected a folder to be synced, The green cloud won't be green when you traverse to sub-folders.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Legend:</strong></h2>
<p><img src="connecting.png" alt="" />&nbsp;Trying to connect to the ftp server.</p>
<p><img src="sending.png" alt="" />&nbsp;Sending File</p>
<p><img src="sent.png" alt="" />&nbsp;File was sent successfully</p>
<p><img src="sending_failed.png" alt="" />&nbsp;Failed to send file. There are several possible reasons for that:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
    <li>because the FTP folder does not exists</li>
    <li>failed to create folder on ftp</li>
    <li>no enough space on ftp server</li>
    <li>failed to connect because the credintails are invalid</li>
    <li>failed to connect because the ftp configuration is incorrect</li>
</ul>
